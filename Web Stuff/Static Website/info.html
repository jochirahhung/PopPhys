        <p>What the game grumps do is skit comedy and they record gameplay videos and skits that make people laugh and they bring enjoyment to the world of youtube. Then you have
            the band side, Danny runs a band called Ninja Sex Party with Brian, and Arin is in a band with Danny and Brian called StarBomb. And they go on tours around the USA doing either
            Game Grumps Live shows, or concerts.
